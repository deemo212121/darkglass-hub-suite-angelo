-- 0385 — Payroll: Finance / Admin / SuperAdmin can include or exclude
-- their OWN row on Accounting → Payroll.
--
-- 0225/0301 blocked every self-edit of profiles.payroll_excluded, so the
-- person running payroll could never check their own row ("Your own row was
-- left as is"). Now Finance, Admin, SuperAdmin and SuperSuperAdmin (primary
-- or extra role) may change their own; everyone else is still blocked.
--
-- Same function as 0301 otherwise, unchanged.
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL Editor.
